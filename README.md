RY Paris Burger Project

Website Usage Notes - 
The RY PARIS logo in the top left of the header is a link back to index.html (home page). The only other working link for the project is 'Popular Recipes' to take you to the second page for 'Hamburger of the week'. 

Developer's Thoughts -
I found myself going back and questioning naming conventions used for classes, mostly due to highly specific class names that could be reused, but when looking at the html didn't make much sense. I went back several times to attempt to generalize class names in an attempt to organize the html a little better and enhance the reusibility of classes.
